* Requirements
  The following requirements are needed for cluster setup on
  Baadal.

  Based on the above documents( above links), extracted some
  information. 

  The following basic hardware requirements are needed for
  base machine to setup cluster.

  1. VM with following resource requirements.
      |----------------+--------------|
      | Resource       | Fixed        |
      |                | (or Minimum) |
      |----------------+--------------|
      | RAM            | 16 GB        |
      | Disk           | 1 TB         |
      | CPU            | 16 Cores     |
      | I/O throughput | 1000 IOPS    |
      |----------------+--------------|
  2. CentOS-6.9 Operating system

  3. A VM with One public IP.

      This is needed for DNS. We need to register the IP
      with domain name provider.

  4. Two LAN IPs 
      
      These two LAN IPs are needed for router and
      ansible/config containers.

  5. Internet facility without network proxy is needed.
  6. Full access to the VM including SSH access from
      IIIT-Hyderabad. That means, no firewall rules (
      Iptables). We set our own firewall rules according to
      our requirements.
