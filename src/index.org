  The following basic hardware requirements are needed for
  base machine to setup cluster.
** Two VMs with following information
  1. VM with following resource requirements.
      |----------------+--------------|

      | CPU            | 16 Cores     |
      | I/O throughput | 1000 IOPS    |
      |----------------+--------------|
  2. CentOS-6.9 Operating system

  3. One Public IP and Three LAN IPs with Internet access.
     - One LAN IP for Host machine ( VM ) along with Public
       IP. VM should have two Network Interfaces.
       + One for Public IP ( eth0 )
       + One for LAN IP    ( eth1 )
     - One LAN IP for router container and
     - One LAN IP for config/ansible container
  4. Firewall rules
     1. The following ports should be opened for incoming
        traffic.
	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        22(SSH),80(HTTP),443(HTTPS),53(DNS tcp and udp) and 8080
	#+END_EXAMPLE
     2. Outgoing access on all ports
  5. Availability

     The VM should be available all times. That means, the
     server should not go down or shutdown at any time. 

  6. Internet access.

     Always Internet access should be available to the VM.
  7. Admin Support from Baadal
     
     In case of any issues with the provided VM, VEAD Team
     may need support from Baadal to troubleshoot and fixing
     the issues.
