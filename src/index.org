* Requirements
  The following requirements are needed for cluster setup on
  Baadal.

  Based on the above documents( above links), extracted some
  information. 

  The following basic hardware requirements are needed for
  base machine to setup cluster.

  1. VM with following resource requirements.
      |----------------+--------------|
      | Resource       | Fixed        |
      |                | (or Minimum) |
      |----------------+--------------|
      | RAM            | 16 GB        |
      | Disk           | 1 TB         |
      | CPU            | 16 Cores     |
      | I/O throughput | 1000 IOPS    |
      |----------------+--------------|
  2. CentOS-6.9 Operating system

  3. One Public IP and Three LAN IPs with Internet access.
     - One LAN IP for Host machine ( VM ) along with Public
       IP. VM should have two Network Interfaces.
       + One for Public IP ( eth0 )
       + One for LAN IP    ( eth1 )
     - One LAN IP for router container and
     - One LAN IP for config/ansible container
  4. Internet access without network proxy is needed.
  5. Full access to the VM including SSH access from
     IIIT-Hyderabad. That means, without any firewall rules
     ( Iptables) set on the VM. We set our own firewall
     rules according to our requirements.
